As research in the field of sleep science continues to evolve, the positive effects of adequate sleep on physical and mental health are revealed.Sleep health issues have been widely reported in the media, including the potential health risks of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality.At the same time, the development and popularization of sleep tracking technology makes it easier for people to monitor and evaluate their sleep patterns.Tools such as smart watches and smartphone apps provide real-time access to personal sleep data, drawing more attention to sleep conditions.More and more people are paying attention to how to improve sleep to relieve life stress and improve quality of life."
